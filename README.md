## Hi, I'm Steven 👋

I am a **Lecturer (~Assistant Professor) in Computer Science** at the University of York, where I am leading [Real-Time and Flexible Cyber-Physical Systems Lab](https://www.xiaotiandai.com/lab). I'm based in the beautiful, medieval city of York, United Kingdom.

With over a decade of R&D experience in real-time, embedded and cyber-physical systems, I’m passionate about exploring how **systems engineering**, **AI** and **robotics** can shape a better future. I'm both a researcher and a (full-stack) enthusiast in robotics!

I strongly believe that the computer science community can thrive by open-sourcing our work. To contribute to that vision, most of my research code is available on GitHub, organized in this [GitHub list](https://github.com/stars/automaticdai/lists/my-research-projects). 

Feel free to talk with me for collobration!
