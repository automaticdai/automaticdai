I am a **Research Associate in Computer Science** ([Real-Time Systems Research Group](https://www.cs.york.ac.uk/rts/), University of York, UK). I have 10 years research and development experience in real-time and embedded systems. I believe the computer science research community could be much improved by open sourcing their code and artifacts. To work torwards it, most of my own research code is here on this GitHub (with a repo name starting with *research-\**). 

Also as a robot enthusiast, I envision a better future with technology of AI and robotics. With this vision, I founded **YF Robotics Lab** (YFRL), a non-profit robot organisation, to promote robotic technology to the public. YFRL started as a personal blog in 2010, and now is a group of robot researchers, developers, and enthusiasts around the world.
