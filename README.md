### Hi I'm automatic.dai ðŸ‘‹

I am a **Lecturer (Assistant Professor) in Computer Science**, working in the [Real-Time and Distributed Systems Research Group](https://www.cs.york.ac.uk/rts/), University of York, based in York, United Kingdom. 

I have over ten years of research and development experience in real-time embedded and cyber-physical systems. I am also a robot researcher as well as an enthusiast, and I envision a better future with the technology of AI and robotics.

I believe the computer science research community could be largely benefited by open-sourcing their code and artefacts. To work toward it, most of my research code is here on this GitHub (with a repo name starting with *research-\**).
