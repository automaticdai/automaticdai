### Hi I'm automatic.dai ðŸ‘‹

I am a **Lecturer (Assistant Professor) in Computer Science**, working in the [Real-Time and Distributed Systems Research Group](https://www.cs.york.ac.uk/rts/), University of York, UK. 

I have over ten years research and development experience in real-time embedded systems, robotics and cyber-physical systems. I believe the computer science research community could be largely benefited by open-sourcing their code and artifacts. To work torwards it, most of my research code is here on this GitHub (with a repo name starting with *research-\**). 

As a robot researcher and enthusiast, I envision a better future with technology of AI and robotics. With this vision in mind, I founded **YF Robotics Lab** (YFRL), a non-profit robot organisation, to promote robotic technology to the public. YFRL was started as a personal blog in 2010, and now is a group of robot researchers, developers, and enthusiasts around the world.
