### Hi I'm Steven ðŸ‘‹

I am a **Lecturer (~Assistant Professor) in Computer Science** at the University of York, where I'm part of the [Real-Time and Distributed Systems Research Group](https://www.cs.york.ac.uk/rts/). I'm based in the beautiful, medieval city of York, United Kingdom.

With over a decade of R&D experience in real-time, embedded and cyber-physical systems, Iâ€™m passionate about exploring how AI and robotics can shape a better future. I'm both a researcher and an enthusiast in the field of robotics!

I strongly believe that the computer science community can thrive by open-sourcing our work. To contribute to that vision, most of my research code is available on GitHub, organized in this [GitHub list](https://github.com/stars/automaticdai/lists/my-research-projects). Feel free to explore!
