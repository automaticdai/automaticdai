## Hi, I'm Steven 👋

📍York, London, Shenzhen  

I am a **Lecturer (~Assistant Professor) in Computer Science** at the University of York, where I lead [Real-Time and Flexible Cyber-Physical Systems Lab (ReFLEX)](https://www.xiaotiandai.com/lab). I'm based in the beautiful, medieval city of York, United Kingdom.

With over a decade of R&D experience in real-time, embedded and cyber-physical systems, I'm passionate about exploring how **systems engineering**, **AI** and **robotics** can shape a better future. I'm a researcher, a blogger and a (full-stack) developer in robotics and embedded AI!

I strongly believe that the computer science community can thrive by open-sourcing our work. To contribute to that vision, most of my research code is available on GitHub.
